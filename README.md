# UROY 2024
Code and data for my 2024 UROY analysis.


## Data

- `uroy-results.csv` contains data on the top 10 UROY finishers for both male and female categories. It also includes each race they ran in 2024 and their placing the that race. This data was created by hand from [ultrarunning.com](https://ultrarunning.com/tag/2024uroy/).

# Notes to me

- Only ultra-distance events were considered (i.e., Eli Hemming's VK at Broken Arrow was not included)
